It is possible that the last value in values is "chunked", meaning that the rest of the value is sent in subsequent `PartialResultSet`(s). This is denoted by the chunked_value field. Two or more chunked values can be merged to form a complete value as follows: * `bool/number/null`: cannot be chunked * `string`: concatenate the strings * `list`: concatenate the lists. If the last element in a list is a `string`, `list`, or `object`, merge it with the first element in the next list by applying these rules recursively. * `object`: concatenate the (field name, field value) pairs. If a field name is duplicated, then apply these rules recursively to merge the field values. Some examples of merging: # Strings are concatenated. "foo", "bar" => "foobar" # Lists of non-strings are concatenated. [2, 3], [4] => [2, 3, 4] # Lists are concatenated, but the last and first elements are merged # because they are strings. ["a", "b"], ["c", "d"] => ["a", "bc", "d"] # Lists are concatenated, but the last and first elements are merged # because they are lists. Recursively, the last and first elements # of the inner lists are merged because they are strings. ["a", ["b", "c"]], [["d"], "e"] => ["a", ["b", "cd"], "e"] # Non-overlapping object fields are combined. {"a": "1"}, {"b": "2"} => {"a": "1", "b": 2"} # Overlapping object fields are merged. {"a": "1"}, {"a": "2"} => {"a": "12"} # Examples of merging objects containing lists of strings. {"a": ["1"]}, {"a": ["2"]} => {"a": ["12"]} For a more complete example, suppose a streaming SQL query is yielding a result set whose rows contain a single string field. The following `PartialResultSet`s might be yielded: { "metadata": { ... } "values": ["Hello", "W"] "chunked_value": true "resume_token": "Af65..." } { "values": ["orl"] "chunked_value": true } { "values": ["d"] "resume_token": "Zx1B..." } This sequence of `PartialResultSet`s encodes two rows, one containing the field value `"Hello"`, and a second containing the field value `"World" = "W" + "orl" + "d"`. Not all `PartialResultSet`s contain a `resume_token`. Execution can only be resumed from a previously yielded `resume_token`. For the above sequence of `PartialResultSet`s, resuming the query with `"resume_token": "Af65..."` will yield results from the `PartialResultSet` with value `["orl"]`.',
